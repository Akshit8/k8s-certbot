# Free SSL on Kubernetes with Cert-manager

<img src="assets/k8s-certmanager.png"/>

SSL certificate is the single most crucial component enabling secure communication between server and client. When deploying a fleet of services on Kubernetes, securing both the internal and external network traffic can be tricky. To our rescue comes **Cert-manager**, a Kubernetes native certificate manager.

<br/>

At the end of this tutorial, we'll have secure cluster ingress traffic with a free SSL certificate issued from **Let's Encrypt** using cert-manager.

## What is cert-manager?

Cert-manager is a native Kubernetes certificate management controller. It can help with issuing certificates from a variety of sources, such as Letâ€™s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, self-signed certs, etc.

<br/>

It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date, and attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.

<br/>

Well, cert-manager comprises a variety of components and extensions, but we'll discuss those that are required for this tutorial. Do check out related concepts [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/).

<br/>

- **Issuer** - component that talks to `CA authorities` and requests a certificate on demand.

- **Certificate** - it defines a certificate request as a Kubernetes resource, and this request is pushed to `Issuer`, and the issued certificate is then stored as a k8s secret object.

## Requirements

Kubernetes cluster installed with `Nginx-ingress` and accessible with `kubectl` is required. I am using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to deploy a test kubernetes cluster, but you can choose any distribution of kubernetes of your choice.

For using Kind, you may refer to its [installation docs](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

## Installing cert-manager with regular manifests

Install the `CustomResourceDefinitions` and `cert-manager`:

```bash
kubectl create ns cert-manager

kubectl -n cert-manager apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.3.1/cert-manager.yaml
```

<br/>

You can download any other stable release for `cert-manager` from its [releases page](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/).

<br/>

It's a good practice to store the YAML files that you apply to the cluster, in case something goes wrong you can restore the state of the cluster by re-applying them. To store the cert-manager manifest we just applied, run the following scripts.

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.3.1/cert-manager.yaml

mv cert-manager.yaml cert-manager-1.3.1.yaml
```

To verify the installation

```bash
kubectl -n cert-manager get all
```

```

## Deploying sample app

For testing issued SSL certificate, let's deploy a simple REST API in the cluster as well. Once deployed we'll route the traffic to this app using `Nginx-ingress`.

<br/>

The source code for the sample app is inside the [app](https://github.com/Akshit8/k8s-certmanager/tree/master/app) directory and infrastructure files are contained inside the [infra](https://github.com/Akshit8/k8s-certmanager/tree/master/infra) folder.

<br/>

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./service.yaml
```

Do make sure service and deployment components are up and running.

## Setting up domain and ingress controller

Since we'll obtain SSL certificate from `let's encrypt`, in order to verify ownership of the domain, let's encrypt will send an [ACME](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/) challenge. So before setting up Issuer and certificate we need to point our domain name to our cluster.

<br/>

If you are using a cloud provider point domain to the `load balancer`, for kind cluster or any other bare metal setup pointing to public IP of host machine will work fine.

<br/>

Also, make sure the ingress controller is running and accepting traffic for your domain. Ping `your-domain.com` and you should be able to see a **404 Not Found** page. This indicates there are no routes to `/` and the ingress controller is running.

If you are not able to get the above result, make sure Nginx-ingress is installed and enabled inside the cluster. Refer to its installation guide [here](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/).

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
  name: certmanager-app-ingress

  rules:
    - host: yourdomain.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: certmanager-app-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Copy the above code to `ingress.yaml` and apply it in the default namespace.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./ingress.yaml
```

To verify the routing, access any endpoint of your REST API.

## Let's issue a free SSL!

Files used in this section are present in [certmanager](https://github.com/Akshit8/k8s-certmanager/tree/master/certmanager) dir.

**Step 1 Create a Let's Encrypt Issuer for our cluster** <br/>

Creating a **ClusterIssuer**, allows us to issue and manage certificates in any namespace.

```bash
kubectl apply -f issuer.yaml
```

Verify the issuer is running and set to make the request.

```bash
kubectl describe clusterissuer letsencrypt-cluster-issuer
```

```
Name:         letsencrypt-cluster-issuer
Namespace:
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>
API Version:  cert-manager.io/v1
Kind:         ClusterIssuer

Status:
  Acme:
    Last Registered Email:  your-email@email.com
    Uri:                    https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/107894884
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2021-04-30T17:40:12Z
    Message:               The ACME account was registered with the ACME server
    Reason:                ACMEAccountRegistered
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
Events:                    <none>
```

**Step 2 Issue a certificate for our domain** <br/>

```bash
kubectl apply -f certificate.yaml
```

Verify if the certificate has been issued.

```bash
kubectl describe certificate certmanager-app
```

```
Events:
  Type    Reason     Age    From          Message
  ----    ------     ----   ----          -------
  Normal  Issuing    2m22s  cert-manager  Issuing certificate as Secret does not exist
  Normal  Generated  2m22s  cert-manager  Stored new private key in temporary Secret resource "certmanager-app-z88vv"
  Normal  Requested  2m22s  cert-manager  Created new CertificateRequest resource "certmanager-app-hnhn6"
  Normal  Issuing    104s   cert-manager  The certificate has been successfully issued
```

A tls secret would have been successfully created.

```bash
kubectl get secrets
```

```
NAME                       TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
cert-manager-app-tls       kubernetes.io/tls                     2      84m
```

To learn more about kubernetes secret and tls secret click [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

**Step 3 Update the ingress to enforce issued SSL** <br/>

Copy the ingress configuration from [certmanager/ingress.yaml](https://github.com/Akshit8/k8s-certmanager/blob/master/certmanager/ingress.yaml) and paste it inside `ingress.yaml`

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./ingress.yaml
```

Open the link https://your-domain.com inside the browser and you'll be able to see the lock sign(left to the domain) ensuring that the SSL certificate is installed and the payload to-from server is encrypted.

## Conclusion

While there are many ways to set up SSL certificates inside your cluster, I like to use cert-manager as it's

- Easy to install.
- Supports ACME (Let's Encrypt), HashiCorp Vault, Venafi, self-signed, and internal certificate authorities.
- Provide tools to manage certificates.

If you want to use any other CA or configuration, checkout [certmanager-configuration-docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/)
